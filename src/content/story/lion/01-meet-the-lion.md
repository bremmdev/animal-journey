### Overview

Scientific Name: Panthera leo
Family: Felidae
Habitat: Lions are primarily found in the grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population also inhabiting the Gir Forest of India.
Diet: Lions are apex predators, preying mainly on large herbivores such as wildebeests, zebras, and buffalo. Lionesses are the primary hunters within a pride, employing coordinated hunting tactics to bring down prey.
Average Lifespan: In the wild, lions typically live for 10 to 14 years, while those in captivity can live up to 20 years or more.
Physical Characteristics: Lions are characterized by their muscular build, tawny-colored fur, and distinctive mane in males. Males typically have larger manes that vary in color from blond to black, while females lack a mane and have a sleeker appearance.
Social Structure: Lions are highly social animals, living in groups known as prides. A pride typically consists of several related lionesses, their offspring, and one or more dominant males. These social structures provide protection, support for hunting, and opportunities for mating.
Reproduction: Lionesses give birth to litters of one to six cubs, with a gestation period of around 110 days. Cubs are raised communally within the pride, with all lionesses participating in caregiving and protection.
Conservation Status: Lions are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with populations declining due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching.
